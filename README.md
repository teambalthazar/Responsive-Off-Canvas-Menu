Responsive Off Canvas Menu
==========================

A tweak to the responsive off-canvas menu using CSS transforms and transitions featured in a Smashing Magazine article by David Bushell.

**[Implementing Off-Canvas Navigation For A Responsive Website

I've changed the css file to put the menu on the right side of the screen, instead of the left.
